# STEM repo standards adoption

Single source of truth for which `llm-settings` Standard version each STEM repo follows.

The repo itself also declares the same version in its top-level `CLAUDE.md` (see `shared/templates/CLAUDE.md`). This file mirrors those declarations so a single glance shows which repos lag.

## Repos

| Repo | Archetype | Standard version | Last bumped | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stem-device-manager` | A | — | — | not yet adopted |
| `stem-communication` | B | — | — | not yet adopted; rename + sub-package split planned |
| `stem-production-tracker` | A | — | — | not yet adopted |
| `stem-button-panel-tester` | A | v1.1.1 | 2026-05-05 | structural adoption — PR #1 |
| `stem-dictionaries-manager` | B | — | — | not yet adopted |
| `spark-log-analyzer` | A | — | — | not yet adopted |
| `llm-settings` | C | n/a | n/a | self-referential — defines the standards |

## Archetype legend

- **A — Desktop App.** Avalonia + FuncUI, end-user GUI, packaged release artifacts (`release.yml` workflow).
- **B — Library.** NuGet-publishable, hexagonal layout (`Abstractions`, `Protocol`, `Drivers.*`, optional `DependencyInjection`).
- **C — Meta/Config.** No runtime build (`llm-settings` itself).
- **D — New (placeholder).** Triggers a `new-archetype` design session when a candidate repo doesn't fit A/B/C.

## Updating this table

When a repo is bumped to a new Standard version:

1. Bump the `**Standard version:**` line in that repo's `CLAUDE.md` to the new tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`).
2. Update the `Standard version` and `Last bumped` columns here.
3. If the bump is a major version, open a follow-up migration PR per repo (the `MIGRATION` standard documents the per-version steps).
4. Commit both changes together when possible — the per-repo `CLAUDE.md` change can land with whatever PR triggers the bump, and this file is updated in `llm-settings` immediately afterwards.

## Naming convention for the version field

- `v1.0.0` — git tag from `llm-settings`. Always with the `v` prefix, always full SemVer triple.
- `—` — repo exists but has not yet adopted any standard.
- `n/a` — concept of a Standard version doesn't apply to this repo (e.g. `llm-settings` itself).
